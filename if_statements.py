# if statements
# an example of how if statements work:
#   if condition:
#       do this

# if/else statements
drink_water = True # must have a boolean in order for this to work
if drink_water:
    print("I drink water") # if drink_water is true, prints this line
else:
    print("I drink soda") # if false, prints this line instead
