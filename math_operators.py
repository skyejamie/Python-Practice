# mathematical operators
expression = 2 + 2 # expression variable example
print (expression) # prints the result (must have a space between "print" and "(var name)", not sure why but whatever)

# variables in the expression

#division variable expression
a = 144 # you can put in any letter, doesn't matter
b = 12
print(a / b) # (unlike the one above, you don't need to use space) this divides both variables and prints the result, you can use any of the following operators ( + (add), - (subtract & negative numbers), * (multiply), / (divide), ** (exponents), % (remainders) )

# exponent variable expression
f = 5
g = 10
print(f ** g) # calculates the exponent variables and prints the result

# remainder variable expression
y = 23
z = 2
print(y % z) # prints the left over

# negative variable expression
l = 9
m = 5
a = 4
o = 2
print(-l + m + a + o) # (the 9 in the "L" variable turns into a -9 because the "-" sign is infront of the "L" variable in the print function) adds them all and prints the result

# cubed math operator
cubed = 5 ** 3 # add ** and then (number) turns the second number into an exponent
print (cubed) # prints the result of the cube

# quartic variable expression
c = 2
d = 4
print(c ** d) # prints the result turning the number in the "c" variable raise to the power of whatever number that's in the "d" variable (which in this case, it's 4)
